# Heart-Attack-

This research was done in groups and was conducted to classify and identify the symptoms that cause it
heart attack in someone by using data mining techniques. Decision Tree Algorithm
is one of the data mining techniques that can classify by processing the variables that
exist in the dataset. These variables are classified according to their attributes. The Decision Tree algorithm breaks down into
in smaller subsets then in real time a stepwise decision tree
developed. With the Decision Tree Algorithm can provide predictive information to describe
process associated with the prediction of symptoms leading to cardiac arrest. data characteristics
classification can be obtained clearly, both in the form of a decision tree structure and rules so that
in the testing phase with Anaconda software using the Python programming language can help
in predicting heart attack symptoms. Making a classification model with machine learning will
increases the accuracy of decision making because it can test using a larger data size
than the size of the data in traditional methods. Models with good precision and performance make it easier
and speed up the process of identifying heart disease in a person.
